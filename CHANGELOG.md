# Changelog

## 0.49.0 - 2026-10-21

- Extend exact `CNV_REAL_STR` fixed formatting from 0/1/2 to 0..254 fractional
  digits, with a bounded rational calculation and no host decimal rounding.
- Preserve strict REAL/INTEGER inputs, positive minimum widths requiring no extra
  padding, caller STRING capacities and blank/asterisk overflow markers. Rounding,
  scientific notation and precision outside the explicit prototype bound remain
  blocked before output mutation; no native validity range is inferred.
- Add 30 regression checks using independent Decimal formatting oracles, range
  endpoints, long expansions, capacity thresholds and existing effect/reference
  guards, plus a runnable authored example. Validation remains offline.

## 0.48.0 - 2026-10-21

- Add `ARRAY OF STRING[capacity]` function results with constant capacities 1..254,
  plus named ARRAY rows/planes whose terminal elements are bounded STRINGs.
- Keep exact capacity/type/shape checks and independent initialized ASCII copies.
  Reference formals retain caller capacity, which is checked at RETURN; no result
  truncation or inferred temporary capacity. Existing context/effect/cleanup
  checks and direct STRING result rejection remain.
- Add 45 regression checks and a runnable authored STRING ARRAY example. The
  combined result forms are an offline interpretation of the documented ARRAY
  and STRING rules, without native compiler or controller validation.

## 0.47.0 - 2026-10-21

- Resolve unshadowed zero-parameter internal function names as calls in value
  expressions, including scalar conditions and direct ARRAY result assignments.
- Resolve after USING fields and before effect analysis. Keep local storage
  bindings, storage receiver roots and all existing call, argument-order, effect,
  ARRAY-context, recursion and frame-cleanup checks. Explicit calls remain accepted.
- Report bare-call source locations and exact result specifications. Add 54
  regression checks, a runnable authored example and a manual-backed semantic
  contract. Validation remains offline, without native compiler/controller claims.

## 0.46.0 - 2026-10-21

- Add prior named fixed ARRAY elements to unsized anonymous ARRAY function
  results, supporting two or three logical dimensions with one outer dimension.
- Preserve each component's declared identity, shape and terminal element type
  through recursive checked copies and stable destination references. Return
  reports include logical rank and the exact resolved element specification.
- Keep direct-assignment-only use, full known initialization, scalar-leaf limits
  and existing effect/cleanup guards. Named outer results, flat multidimensional
  sources, terminal STRING arrays and whole ARRAY value arguments remain blocked.
- Add 40 regression checks and an authored named-component ARRAY example.
  Validation remains offline, without native compiler or controller claims.

## 0.45.0 - 2026-10-21

- Add unsized anonymous one-dimensional ARRAY function results with prior named
  STRUCTURE, CONFIG/VECTOR/XYZWPR/XYZWPREXT/POSITION and exact-width JOINTPOS elements.
- Reuse recursive checked copies that retain nominal types, nested shapes, STRING
  field capacities, joint widths and POSITION orientation protection. Every scalar
  leaf must be known and initialized; the 32767 scalar-leaf limit still applies.
- Retain direct-assignment-only use, exact destination type/length and existing
  effect, alias and frame-cleanup guards. Broader result forms remain blocked.
- Add 46 regression checks and an authored aggregate ARRAY example. Evidence is
  offline; no controller defaults, native ABI or runtime equivalence is inferred.

## 0.44.0

- Support checked BYTE/SHORT ARRAY function results alongside the earlier scalar
  ARRAY result subset.
- Establish the public package layout, portable tests/examples, semantic notes,
  repository hygiene checks and wheel/source distribution metadata.
